# MonteCarlo_Gas_of_Hard_Spheres
Simulation for a gas of hard spheres in 3-dimensional space. We calculate the radial distribution function for different particle density usign a Monte Carlo method.

This is an exercise that I had to turn in during the Master in Physics. There are a PDF with the exercise and the developed code in this repository. Graphics are plotted in Gnuplot. I will upload the txt files with the gnuplot comands too.
